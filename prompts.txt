Create a Factory Monitoring System in Python that:

Tracks machines and their sensors (Temperature, Pressure, Vibration).

Calculates machine health based on sensor readings.

Generates alerts if readings are outside safe limits or if sensors are missing.

Loads sensor data from a CSV file.

Supports real-time updates and batched updates.

Displays a report showing total sensors, health score, average/min/max readings, and alerts.

Code should be modular (separate files for Sensor, Machine, FactoryMonitor, and main script) and well-structured.
//to generate unit test cases i gave those test case and generate test cases using above conditions.
Generate unit test cases in JavaScript using Jest for a Factory Monitoring System
// to execute unit test cases "how to execute unit test cases"
generate unit test cases in JavaScript using Jest for a Factory Monitoring System
// FOr task 2 
I have the following messy JavaScript code that has:

inconsistent formatting

syntax errors

unclear variable names

redundant or inefficient logic

Please refactor it to:

Correct all syntax errors

Use consistent and readable formatting

Rename variables to be meaningful

Remove redundant code

Preserve the original functionality
